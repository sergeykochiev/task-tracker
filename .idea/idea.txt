commands

/configure
	needs to be invoked right after the bot lands on the server. its main function is to evaluate which roles and/or users can register chats for the bot to track. sample sequence:
	1. init
	2. request to send roles that have a right to /register
	3. request to send users that have a right to /register
	4. end
	makes server entry in db have pending status on init and configured status on end. pending servers cannot be reconfigured. one conversation only goes with one user

	also right after there should be message that mentions all provided roles and users with a quick guide. it also should be moved to a inside-discord configuration on server join if there is one.
